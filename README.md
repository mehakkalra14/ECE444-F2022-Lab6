Pros and Cons of TDD


PROS:

1. TDD makes the code more modular and hence helps people to learn and understand it better.
2. To write unit tests, the code must be properly modularized and divided. This makes it have a good architecture.
3. It enables faster innovation 
4. It makes code flexible and extensible. Code can be moved around or extended with little risk of breaking it.
5. Refactoring of code becaomes easier as programmers write test code before implementation code.

CONS:

1. It might slow down development specially for rapid iterative processes.
2. Tests have to be changed and maintained when the requirements of the project change.
3. If not written proplerly, tests may increase the run time to a great extent.
4. Tests are hard to write for novice programmers specially after unit tests.
5. Might not suit large complex codebases.
